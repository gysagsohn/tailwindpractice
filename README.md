# Tailwind Practice Project (React + Vite)

This is a simple, responsive frontend project built using:

- **React**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS v4+**

### Purpose

This project was created as a hands-on way for me to:

- Learn the fundamentals of **Tailwind CSS**
- Practice **responsive layouts**
- Build a simple **multi-page app** using React Router
- Use **Vite** for a fast development experience

It includes:

- A 3-page layout: Dashboard, Profile, Contact
- A responsive navigation bar that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Flexbox-based card layout with modal popups
- Clean and semantic Tailwind utility class usage
